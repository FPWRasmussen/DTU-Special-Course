# Wind Energy Analysis Tools

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks developed as a part of the special course "Noise and Visual Impact Analysis in Wind Energy" at DTU (Technical University of Denmark). The notebooks are designed to assist in wind turbine impact assessments, specifically addressing shadow flickering, noise calculations (ISO 9613-2), and generating visual impact assessments using the Google Street View API.
