A common framework for noise assessment methods (CNOSSOS-EU) has been developed by the European Commission in co-operation with the EU Member States to be applied for strategic noise mapping as required by the Environment Noise Directive (2002/49/EC). CNOSSOS-EU represents a harmonised and coherent approach to assess noise levels from the main sources of noise (road traffic, railway traffic, aircraft and industrial) across Europe. This paper outlines the process behind the development of CNOSSOS-EU and the parts of the CNOSSOS-EU core methodological framework which were developed during phase A of the CNOSSOS-EU process (2010–2012), whilst focusing on the main scientific and technical issues that were addressed, and the implementation challenges that are being faced before it can become fully operational in the EU MS.},

This chapter presents an overview of different environmental sound propagation calculation methodologies, of varying complexity, as applied to wind turbines. Available methods can broadly be separated into two categories: empirical or engineering methods and more complex numerical methods. The latter possess the ability to provide highly accurate representations of propagation for specific parameters in certain conditions, but are generally complex and computationally intensive. Their accuracy in practical use will be limited by the imperfect knowledge of the full range of atmospheric and ground conditions along the propagation path. However, they are successfully used to assess the parametric sensitivity of received noise levels and to isolate and better understand individual propagation effects. For most practical applications, engineering methods provide reasonably accurate predictions, provided they are applied correctly within their appropriate scope. Accuracy in this context should be interpreted within the context of the natural variability of environmental sound fields.},

	abstract = {Many methods have been developed and where even implemented in legally binding rules how sound propagation shall be calculated to support the minimization of environmental noise. Especially in the case of such legal requirements it is necessary to ensure that the agreed algorithms are applied in the same way by all experts independent from the software tool they use. With the series of the International Standard ISO 17534 we created a framework to ensure this necessary precision. One of the main pillar of the strategy is to clarify all ambiguous definitions and to close the gaps that will cause different results if programmed by different software developers. With standard ISO 9613-2 examples are shown where even existing definitions had to be modified. It can be stated that all calculation methods have their shortcomings that can only be detected if the method is realized in software and then practically applied. The same is true with the harmonized European calculation method – here abbreviated as “CNOSSOS-EU”. Examples are shown where it was necessary to modify and clarify some definitions before it was possible to create test cases to check the correct implementation of the method.},

Besides this, what type of factors are effective in the industrial noise mapping process were defined, and important basic parameters, which are essential in the industrial noise mapping, were detailed. The preparation of the industrial noise mapping process was explained in detail. It was mentioned that the regions exposed to excessive noise should be defined according to the strategic noise map and improvement plans should be performed. Improvement methods that reduce excessive noise in living spaces are clarified and it was explained how the improvement of environmental quality can be acquired. In this regard, this paper gives information on industrial noise mapping and industrial noise control at the urban scale.},

	abstract = {The aim of this research is to provide a better prediction for noise attenuation using thin rigid barriers. In particular, the paper presents an analysis on four methods of computing the noise attenuation using acoustic barriers: Maekawa-Tatge formulation, Kurze and Anderson algorithm, Menounou formulation, and the general prediction method (GPM-ISO 9613). Accordingly, to improve the GPM, the prediction computation of noise attenuation was optimized for an acoustic barrier by considering new effects, such as attenuation due to geometrical divergence, ground absorption-reflections, and atmospheric absorption. The new method, modified GPM (MGPM), was tested for the optimization of an y-shape edge geometry of the noise barrier and a closed agreement with the experimental data was found in the published literature. The specific y-shape edge geometry of the noise barrier contributes to the attenuation due to the diffraction phenomena. This aspect is based on the Kirchhoff diffraction theory that contains the Huygens-Fresnel theory, which is applied to a semi-infinite acoustic barrier. The new method MGPM of predicting the noise attenuation using acoustic barriers takes into consideration the next phenomena: The effect of the relative position of the receiver, the effect of the proximity of the source or receiver to the midplane of the barrier, the effect of the proximity of the receiver to the shadow boundary, the effect of ground absorption-reflections, the effect of atmospheric absorption, and the meteorological effect due to downwind. The conclusion of the paper reveals the optimization of the method for computing the noise attenuation using acoustic barriers, including the necessary corrections for ISO-9613 and the Sound PLAN software, as well as the optimization on a case study of a specific geometry of the edge barrier.},

	abstract = {The International Standard ISO 9613-2 describes an energy- and ray-based engineering model that is – due to its simplicity and clear structure - widely used for the calculation of sound propagation in the frame of legal requirements. It is clearly not developed to take various meteorological conditions into account and to allow such calculations for individual settings of wind-speed and -direction or for different temperature gradients. But with the predicted mean sound pressure level it covers the majority of such parameter variations and this led to the claim to describe downwind propagation or, equivalently, propagation under a well-developed moderate ground-based temperature inversion. With a framework of additional specifications and testcases developed in the last decade it can be –and is – implemented in software-platforms respecting the requirements of quality assurance and therefore offers a relatively high level of precision in the prediction of noise from planned industrial and infrastructure facilities. In the frame of a revision of this International Standard it is planned to integrate most of these additional specifications that have proven to reduce uncertainties and to increase the precision. Further the reason for some problems in connection with the calculation of the insertion loss of barriers was investigated and some possible alternatives for improvements are presented to open the discussion in the community of acoustic experts.},
